cucumber:
        java- programing language
        selenium - automation web based application

        no reports in selenium
        no common ground for all the team member

        no main method for execution - no control of execution

        smoke
        regression
        framework- thi is the final outcome of the complete concepts

        cucumber as a tool
        cucumber/BDD/gherkin as a framework

        Creat a new project
        File -> new -> project -> maven -> groupId -> artifactId -> click creat
        group id - it means the name of the organization
        artifact id  - it means the name of the project

        we creat the new marven project -
        pom.xml is the configuration file where we will add all the dependencies
        pom.xml is the file we will use to execute our code in the end of the framework
        pom.xml is the file we will use to generate the report

        in our project we get src(source code) folder in which we get main test

        main - the code we write to develop the application, we write it in main

        test - the code we write to test the application, we write it in test

        we delete main folder because we will work with test
        in test folder - we get java - to keep all the java stuff
        we get resources - to keep all non java stuff
